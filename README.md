 <h1>Dance Trump Dance!</h1>
<h5>Matteo Morandini<br>
<small>My first project for the WDI course at General Assembly London</small></h5>

Online game built using <strong>ES6 Javascript</strong> for the logic, <strong>CSS3</strong> for the layout, and <strong>HTML5</strong> for the structure.


##Objectives

My goal was to build a simple-but-effective game that was fun to play (it is a game afterall!) but I also wanted to make it attractive and "trendy" in a way. Hence the topic chosen. 

I was obviously inspired by a cult such as "Dance Revolution", which I then transformed in this outragious, politically in-correct (I guess..), kinky masterpiece.


##Rules

The scope of TDT is to follow randomly generated dance moves, and try to matching them with the directional arrows on the keyboard.

The user is given a starting time of 15 secs, which will either increase by five or decrease by ten whether the entered move matches the expected move, or not.

####Bonus

There is a special move that will be required
